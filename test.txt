Dear Student,

We hope that your Fall Semester is going well! Winter and Spring registrations are right around the corner and our records indicate the following hold has been placed on your student account. The hold will prevent your ability to register for next semester if not resolved when the Winter 2024 enrollment begins on October 16th and Spring 2024 enrollment begins on October 30th.

Advising Hold: Make an appointment to meet with your academic advisor for spring registration. Instructions to locate your advisorâ€™s information can be found here.

Sincerely,
The Solution Center
